Tickets
======================================================================

*Post quickly to lighthouse from your desktop*

Posting to Lighthouse takes forever! I want to make a ticket as fast as if it was Quicksilver, it should have usable defaults that I can set up once and just run with. It shouldnt look like an ass, and it should be callable on a hotkey.

I also want to take a quick look at what tickets I own, and have an easy way to edit them. That's almost there now.

At the minute the first-run experience is crap. But I can get around to that after I'm happy with it doing all I need.

There's also some work towards adding github issue support. First though I'd need to actually use them =)
