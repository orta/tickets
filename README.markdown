Ticketeer (name in progress)
======================================================================

*Post quickly to lighthouse from your desktop*

Posting to Lighthouse takes forever! I want to make a ticket as fast as if it was Quicksilver, it should have usable defaults that I can set up once and just run with. It shouldnt look like an ass, and it should be callable on a hotkey.

At the minute the first-run experience is crap. But I can get around to that after I'm happy with it doing all I need.
